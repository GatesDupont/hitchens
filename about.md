The Very Rare Bird Alert is designed to provide timely updates on rare bird sightings for researchers. The app sources data directly from the eBird API, which collates observations from across Massachusetts, USA. Utilizing a Raspberry Pi 5, the app fetches new data every thirty minutes and updates the content, ensuring that the information on the site is constantly refreshed. This project is a practical application of Conservation Technology, leveraging available tools to enhance the tracking of rare avian species.
